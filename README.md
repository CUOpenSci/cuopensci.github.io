# Cornell Open Science Study Group

Welcome to Cornell Open Science Study Group! Partnering with [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/), we're a group that focuses on sharing skills to explore and promote open science.

### Wait, Why a 'Study Group'?

Our study group is an informal meetup for anyone in the Cornell University community to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and explore open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together. **Anyone can join the Study Group-- you don't have to be an expert coder to do so!**

## For New Members
* **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group Program is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
* **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
* **Join our Slack channel:** a lot of our daily discussions happen on our Slack team channel. If you have a @cornell.edu email, you can use it to sign yourself up [here.](https://cucodesopen.slack.com/signup)
