**Title:** Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks  
**Author:** Elizabeth DuPre & Ross Markello  
**Materials needed:** A [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation   
**Time to Complete:** One Hour  
 [**Workshop Slides**](https://github.com/emdupre/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/intro/jupyter_notebooks.pdf)

**Summary/Context/Objectives:**
1. Learn about **conda**, a package manager for organizing and installing software packages and dependencies
2. Learn about **Jupyter Notebooks**, an open-source tool for data visualization, analysis, and description
3. Use conda to install all the necessary software to run a Jupyter Notebook
4. Create and use a [Python](https://github.com/emdupre/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/intro/jupyter_notebook_demo.ipynb) and [R](https://github.com/emdupre/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/intro/R_notebook_demo.ipynb) Jupyter notebook

**Steps to Complete:**
1. Understand what conda is and how to install it
2. Create a new conda environment and install all the necessary packages to use Jupyter notebooks
3. Open the Jupyter notebook launch page in your browser
4. Create a new (Python) Jupyter notebook
5. Learn about Markdown, a plain-text formatting language that can be used in-line with Jupyter notebooks to provide descriptive text
6. Show how Jupyter notebooks allow for seamless integration between languages like R and Python (using rpy2)
7. Learn about the various languages that can be used natively in a Jupyter notebook (i.e., Python, R, LaTeX, Markdown, bash/shell, HTML)
8. Create a new (R) Jupyter notebook
9. Explore the differences between the Python + R Jupyter notebooks
