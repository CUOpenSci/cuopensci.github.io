### Starting a list of workshop ideas that we can flesh out throughout the semester. Current plan is to alternate workshops/discussions with less formal hacky hours. This will keep up participation and allow for people to practice skills from workshops, but reduces burden of always planning a more formal event too!

Lesson ideas and rough content outlines. Please update outlines, suggest, edit, improve, etc!

Bash 1 - stuff that Joe knows how to do well enough to teach.
  filesystem structure
  navigating the bash shell
  commands, options, getting help
  stringing basic commands together, input/output
  controlling the $PATH 
  optional: more flavor-oriented modifications to .bash_profile
    aliasing, customizing your prompt, 

Bash 2 (Joe does not know this at this moment)
  Looping
  Using bash to run a script over multiple files
  
Regular Expressions (make those punctuation marks work for you like it's creative writing class and you're Louis Armstrong!)
